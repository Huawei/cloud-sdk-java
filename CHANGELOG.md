# Change Log

### 3.0.0 (Latest / Stable)

This is a major milestone release which was driven and lead by @auhlig and @dhague. Special thanks for their major contributions and making this release possible.

As a result we have added 2.0-maintenance branch which is the path to EOL for OpenStack4j 2.0.X series.

##### Breaking Changes

* Java 8 as minimum - therefore dropping support for Jersey2-jdk16 connector
* Upgraded Jackson to 2.7.3
* SLF4j 1.7.21 as sole logging implementation

##### Misc
* Introduced Groovy tests written in Groovy using Betamax to record and replay client-server communication
* Clean split of the implementation by Identity version:
* Package names reflect different  versions (*.identity.v2.* and *.identity.v3.* )
* Instead of the old version-mixed OSClient a OSClientV2 for only Identity V2 API and OSClientV3 for only Identity V3 API are available
* Same refactoring for the OSClientSession: introducing new OSClientSessionV2 and OSClientV3

### 2.20

This marks the last of the 2.X OpenStack4j versioning scheme.  Going forward only critical or specific pull requests will justify future release.  It is strongly encourage to consider moving to OpenStack4j 3.0.X which offers the full Identity V3 Support.
